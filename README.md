## Why Does This Exist?
[Great Solutions](https://github.com/HITGIF/TextFieldBoxes) already exist for Material Design EditText fields, but I wanted a solution for static data, or data that only gets changed via an action (such as a click, or date selection).  The layout only consists of a few Views, but having a lot of them can result in a very inflated layout file and as such I'd much prefer adding a single View.
